# CHECKERS

## The timeless classic, now on digital mahogany!

You know it. You love it. It's here again, and ... it's pretty much just as you remember it. In an effort to conform to global efforts to preserve our planet's precious, limited resources, **we're replacing all cardboard and plastic with binary bits of electronic magic!** Now you can enjoy CHECKERS with your loved ones, knowing that you're doing your part to save the planet while playing!

### Some things to look forward to ...

First, the elephant in the room. I know. ***I KNOW.*** You can double jump in CHECKERS. My brain forgot this, as I believe the last time I played CHECKERS prior to coding this iteration was *thirty years ago.* I'm going to implement double jumping into the game at some point.

Have you chosen the blinking red square too many times, and now have nobody to play with? Well, have I got a (future) solution! When I have the wherewithal to make your computer a savvy-enough CHECKERS player, you'll be able to test your mettle against it in **AI Opponent Mode**.
